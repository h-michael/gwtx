# Glob pattern examples for link operations
# Link multiple files at once using glob patterns

# Why use glob patterns?
#
# Glob patterns are particularly useful for:
#
# 1. Test fixtures and development data
#    - Share personal test data (images, JSON, large files) across worktrees
#    - Keep them out of git tracking
#    - No config changes needed when adding new fixtures
#
# 2. Local configuration files
#    - Link multiple local config files in one rule
#    - Scales as your project grows
#
# 3. Development tools and scripts
#    - Share personal development scripts
#    - Automatically exclude team-shared scripts (git-tracked)
#
# 4. Build caches and temporary files
#    - Link specific cache files to save disk space and build time
#
# The skip_tracked option is especially powerful because:
#    - Keeps git status clean (linked files don't show as untracked)
#    - Automatically distinguishes personal files from team-shared files
#    - Works seamlessly with .gitignore settings

# Example 1: Link all files in a directory
[[link]]
source = "fixtures/*"
description = "Link all files in fixtures directory"

# Example 2: Skip git-tracked files (useful for test fixtures)
[[link]]
source = "fixtures/*"
skip_tracked = true
description = "Link only untracked test fixtures (skips .gitkeep, etc.)"

# Example 3: Link files with specific extension
[[link]]
source = "config/*.json"
description = "Link all JSON config files"

# Example 4: Link dotfiles
[[link]]
source = ".*"
skip_tracked = true
description = "Link untracked dotfiles in repo root"

# Example 5: Recursive glob pattern
[[link]]
source = "**/*.local"
description = "Link all .local files recursively"

# Example 6: Multiple patterns for different purposes
[[link]]
source = "test/fixtures/*.txt"
skip_tracked = true
description = "Link text fixtures"

[[link]]
source = "test/fixtures/*.json"
skip_tracked = true
description = "Link JSON fixtures"

# Supported glob syntax:
#   *       - matches any number of characters
#   ?       - matches a single character
#   [...]   - matches any character in the brackets
#   **      - matches zero or more directories (recursive)
#
# Note: skip_tracked option is useful when you want to:
# - Link only untracked files (e.g., local configs, test data)
# - Keep git status clean by not linking git-tracked files
