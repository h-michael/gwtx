# Glob pattern examples for link operations
# Link multiple files at once using glob patterns

# Why use glob patterns?
#
# Glob patterns are particularly useful for:
#
# 1. Test fixtures and development data
#    - Share personal test data (images, JSON, large files) across worktrees
#    - Keep them out of git tracking
#    - No config changes needed when adding new fixtures
#
# 2. Local configuration files
#    - Link multiple local config files in one rule
#    - Scales as your project grows
#
# 3. Development tools and scripts
#    - Share personal development scripts
#    - Automatically exclude team-shared scripts (git-tracked)
#
# 4. Build caches and temporary files
#    - Link specific cache files to save disk space and build time
#
# The ignore_tracked option is especially powerful because:
#    - Keeps git status clean (linked files don't show as untracked)
#    - Automatically distinguishes personal files from team-shared files
#    - Works seamlessly with .gitignore settings

# Example 1: Link all files in a directory
link:
  - source: fixtures/*
    description: Link all files in fixtures directory

  # Example 2: Skip git-tracked files (useful for test fixtures)
  - source: fixtures/*
    ignore_tracked: true
    description: Link only untracked test fixtures (skips .gitkeep, etc.)

  # Example 3: Link files with specific extension
  - source: config/*.json
    description: Link all JSON config files

  # Example 4: Link dotfiles
  - source: .*
    ignore_tracked: true
    description: Link untracked dotfiles in repo root

  # Example 5: Recursive glob pattern
  - source: '**/*.local'
    description: Link all .local files recursively

  # Example 6: Multiple patterns for different purposes
  - source: test/fixtures/*.txt
    ignore_tracked: true
    description: Link text fixtures

  - source: test/fixtures/*.json
    ignore_tracked: true
    description: Link JSON fixtures

# Supported glob syntax:
#   *       - matches any number of characters
#   ?       - matches a single character
#   [...]   - matches any character in the brackets
#   **      - matches zero or more directories (recursive)
#
# Note: ignore_tracked option is useful when you want to:
# - Link only untracked files (e.g., local configs, test data)
# - Keep git status clean by not linking git-tracked files
