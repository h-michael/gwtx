# Branch template configuration examples
# Used in interactive mode (-i) to suggest branch names when creating new branches

worktree:
  path_template: ../worktrees/{{branch}}
  branch_template: review/{{commitish}}

# Example 1: Simple prefix
# branch_template: review/{{commitish}}
# When creating from "feature/auth" -> Suggested branch name: "review/feature/auth"

# Example 2: With date
# branch_template: review/{{strftime(%Y-%m-%d)}}/{{commitish}}
# When creating from "feature/auth" -> Suggested: "review/2025-01-14/feature/auth"

# Example 3: With repo name
# branch_template: {{repository}}/review/{{commitish}}
# When creating from "feature/auth" in repo "myapp" -> Suggested: "myapp/review/feature/auth"

# Example 4: Date only format
# branch_template: hotfix/{{strftime(%m%d)}}-{{commitish}}
# When creating from "fix-bug" -> Suggested: "hotfix/0114-fix-bug"

# Available variables:
#   {{commitish}} - The commit-ish to create from (branch name, tag, commit hash, etc.)
#   {{repository}} - Repository directory name
#   {{strftime(FORMAT)}} - Current date/time formatted with strftime
#
# Common strftime formats:
#   %Y-%m-%d  -> 2025-01-14
#   %m-%d     -> 01-14
#   %Y%m%d    -> 20250114
#   %H:%M     -> 15:30
#   %Y/%m/%d  -> 2025/01/14
#   %b-%d     -> Jan-14

# Note: The branch template is only used in interactive mode (gwtx add -i)
# when creating a new branch. It provides a suggested name that you can
# accept or modify.
