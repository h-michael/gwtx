# Worktree path configuration examples
# Configure how worktree paths are suggested in interactive mode
# and allow path to be optional in non-interactive mode.

# Example 1: Simple directory prefix (branch appended at the end)
worktree:
  path: ../worktrees/
# Result for branch "feature/foo": ../worktrees/feature/foo

# Example 2: Custom template with branch variable
# worktree:
#   path: ../gwtx-{branch}-
# Result for branch "feature/foo": ../gwtx-feature/foo-

# Example 3: Full template with repo name and branch
# worktree:
#   path: ../{repo_name}-{branch}
# Result for branch "feature/foo" in repo "myrepo": ../myrepo-feature/foo

# Example 4: Absolute path with template
# worktree:
#   path: /home/user/worktrees/{repo_name}/{branch}
# Result: /home/user/worktrees/myrepo/feature/foo

# Example 5: Using {{ }} syntax (equivalent to { })
# worktree:
#   path: ../{{ repo_name }}-{{ branch }}
# Result: ../myrepo-feature/foo

# Available variables:
#   {branch} or {{ branch }}       - Branch name as-is (e.g., feature/foo)
#   {repo_name} or {{ repo_name }} - Repository directory name (e.g., myrepo)
#
# Note: Both relative and absolute paths are allowed
# Note: Both {var} and {{var}} syntax are supported
# Note: Spaces inside braces are allowed: {{ branch }}, {{  branch  }}, etc.
